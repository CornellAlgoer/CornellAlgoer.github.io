      Our Mission...
    </h2>
    <p>
      Is to be a resource for those who have decided to be a part of the ever growing
      tech industry. A sanctuary for those who committed to computer science later in
      their professional careers. And most importantly, a community that will support
      each in other in our common goal to take control of our own careers.
